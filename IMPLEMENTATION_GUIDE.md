# Combined CSV + Scraper Implementation Guide

## 🎯 **The Solution: Combined Approach**

Since CSV files don't contain prices and availability, we need to **combine both sources**:

### **✅ What Each Source Provides:**

**CSV Files (Event Data):**
- ✅ **Accurate dates and times** (from your system)
- ✅ **Real locations** (from your system)
- ✅ **Event URLs** (from your system)
- ✅ **No duplicates** (clean data)
- ❌ **No prices** (missing)
- ❌ **No availability** (missing)
- ❌ **No product URLs** (missing)

**Scraped Data (Product Data):**
- ✅ **Real prices** (from website JSON-LD)
- ✅ **Real availability** (from website JSON-LD)
- ✅ **Product URLs** (from website JSON-LD)
- ❌ **Duplicate events** (from multiple calendar pages)
- ❌ **Inaccurate dates** (from calendar pages)

## 🔧 **Implementation Strategy:**

### **Step 1: Import CSV Data**
```sql
-- Create table for CSV event data
CREATE TABLE csv_events (
  event_url TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  subtype TEXT,
  date_start TIMESTAMP,
  date_end TIMESTAMP,
  start_time TIME,
  end_time TIME,
  event_location TEXT
);

-- Import CSV data (run this in Supabase)
COPY csv_events FROM 'path/to/your/csv/file.csv' 
WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true);
```

### **Step 2: Use Combined Views**
- **Event data** comes from CSV files (accurate, no duplicates)
- **Product data** comes from scraped data (prices, availability)
- **Join them together** to get complete information

### **Step 3: Update Chatbot**
- **Use `v_event_product_pricing_combined`** for event queries
- **Get accurate event data** from CSV
- **Get real prices** from scraped data
- **No duplicates** or data quality issues

## 📊 **Expected Results:**

With the combined approach, you'll get:
- ✅ **~128 unique events** (from CSV files)
- ✅ **Real dates, times, locations** (from CSV)
- ✅ **Real prices, availability** (from scraped data)
- ✅ **No duplicates** (clean CSV data)
- ✅ **Complete information** (both sources combined)

## 🚀 **Benefits:**

1. **Best of Both Worlds**: Accurate event data + real product data
2. **No Duplicates**: Clean CSV data as source of truth
3. **Real Prices**: Scraped product information
4. **Scalable**: Easy to update CSV data
5. **Reliable**: No dependency on complex deduplication logic

## 📋 **Next Steps:**

1. **Import CSV data** into the database
2. **Run the combined approach** SQL
3. **Test the results** to confirm accuracy
4. **Update the chatbot** to use combined views
5. **Set up regular CSV updates** for new events

This approach gives you **the complete, accurate dataset** you need without the complexity of deduplication!
