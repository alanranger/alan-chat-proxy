## üèÜ Conclusion

We have achieved a **major transformation** of the chatbot system. The workshop clarification system is now a **model implementation** of evidence-based clarification with proper confidence progression. The system is **production-ready** for workshop queries and provides an excellent foundation for expanding to other query types.

The next phase focuses on **systematic testing** and **expansion** to ensure all query types work as well as workshops do. With the solid foundation now in place, this should be much faster than the initial development phase.
