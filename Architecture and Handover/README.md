## **üéØ Implementation Priority**

### **Phase 1: Core Context Extraction (Immediate)**
1. **Multi-question parsing:** Handle compound user questions
2. **Constraint detection:** Location, budget, schedule, skill level, equipment
3. **Specific request parsing:** "bluebells ones", "Sunday 17 May 2026"
4. **Context-aware routing:** Route based on user constraints

### **Phase 2: Intelligent Resource Bundling (Short-term)**
1. **URL count logic:** 1-3 URLs based on query complexity
2. **Resource selection:** Choose appropriate content types
3. **Related resource identification:** Bundle complementary content
4. **Alternative option provision:** Online when location doesn't work

### **Phase 3: Advanced Response Generation (Medium-term)**
1. **Response templates:** Different styles for different query types
2. **Context acknowledgment:** Address user constraints first
3. **Limitation handling:** Honest about what's not available
4. **Engagement optimization:** Follow-up questions and CTAs

### **Phase 4: Interactive Clarification System (Long-term)**
1. **Follow-up question generation:** Ask for clarification when needed
2. **Conversation flow management:** Handle multi-turn interactions
3. **Context persistence:** Remember user constraints across turns
4. **Dynamic response adaptation:** Adjust based on user responses

## **üìà Expected Impact**
