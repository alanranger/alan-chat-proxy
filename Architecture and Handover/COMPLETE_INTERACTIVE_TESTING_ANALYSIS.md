## **üîç Advanced Pattern Analysis**

### **1. Multi-Part User Questions (Questions 5, 8, 12, 16, 20)**
- **Question 5:** "how long has he been teaching and where is he based?"
- **Question 8:** "what are the dates and cost and is it suitable for beginners? where are they?"
- **Question 12:** "i m a beginner, is that ok? what sort of camera do i need?"
- **Question 16:** "no i want something close to Birmingham"
- **Question 20:** "are you qualified?"

**Pattern:** Users ask multiple related questions in one follow-up, requiring comprehensive responses.

### **2. Context-Rich User Responses (All Questions)**
- **Location constraints:** "cant get to coventry", "close to Birmingham"
- **Budget constraints:** "can spend about ¬£100"
- **Equipment context:** "i use a sony", "my camera is over 10yrs old"
- **Skill level context:** "i m a beginner", "I am intermediate"
- **Schedule constraints:** "work rota and shifts mean i cant do regular evening classes"
- **Specific requests:** "the bluebells ones", "the one for Sunday 17 May 2026"

**Pattern:** Users provide detailed context to get better, more targeted recommendations.

### **3. Multi-URL Response Patterns**
- **1 URL (7 questions):** Simple, specific requests
- **2 URLs (6 questions):** Service options or related resources
- **3 URLs (7 questions):** Comprehensive resource sets

**Pattern:** URL count correlates with query complexity and user needs.

### **4. Response Type Variations**
- **Feature lists with CTAs:** Online course enrollment
- **Direct answers:** About Alan's experience and qualifications
- **Resource recommendations:** Camera guides, exposure articles
- **Option comparisons:** Private lesson formats, course formats
- **Information provision:** Workshop dates, costs, locations
- **Limitation acknowledgment:** "I don't offer anything on astrophotography"
- **Alternative suggestions:** Online courses when location doesn't work

**Pattern:** Response style matches query type, user context, and business constraints.

### **5. Business Logic Sophistication**
- **Constraint recognition:** Location, budget, schedule, skill level, equipment age
- **Resource bundling:** Related articles, multiple service options
- **Limitation acknowledgment:** Honest about what's not available
- **Package information:** Discounts, ad-hoc booking options
- **Alternative routing:** Online options when location doesn't work
- **Qualification transparency:** Direct links to credentials

**Pattern:** Business responses are context-aware, honest, and comprehensive.

## **üöÄ Implementation Requirements (Complete Dataset)**

### **1. Multi-Question Parsing Engine**
- **Parse compound questions:** "dates and cost and is it suitable for beginners? where are they?"

### **2. Advanced Context Extraction**
- **Budget detection:** "can spend about ¬£100"
- **Equipment detection:** "i use a sony", "my camera is over 10yrs old"
- **Skill level detection:** "i m a beginner", "I am intermediate"
- **Location detection:** "cant get to coventry", "close to Birmingham"
- **Schedule detection:** "work rota and shifts"
- **Time constraints:** "the one for Sunday 17 May 2026"
- **Specific preferences:** "the bluebells ones", "any outdoor photography"

### **3. Intelligent Resource Bundling**
- **Single resource:** Specific, targeted requests (7 questions)
- **Related resources:** Technical topics need multiple articles (7 questions)
- **Service options:** Multiple formats (face-to-face vs online) (6 questions)
