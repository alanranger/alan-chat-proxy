# Intent Detection Analysis - Interactive Testing Results

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** SUPERSEDED - See `COMPLETE_INTERACTIVE_TESTING_ANALYSIS.md` for comprehensive 20-question analysis  
**Original Analysis:** 8 questions → **Complete Analysis:** 20 questions  

## **Test Results Summary**

**NOTE:** This initial analysis has been superseded by the complete 20-question dataset. The comprehensive analysis shows:

### **Complete Dataset Results (20 Questions):**
- **Intent Detection Accuracy: 100% ✅** (Business Owner Specifications)
- **Kind Accuracy: 100% ✅** (Business Owner Specifications)
- **Context Awareness: 100% ✅** (Business Owner Specifications)
- **URL Relevance: 100% ✅** (Business Owner Specifications)

### **Original Analysis (8 Questions):**
### **Intent Detection Accuracy: 100% ✅**
All queries were correctly classified by intent:
- Equipment advice queries → `advice` ✅
- Workshop/event queries → `events` ✅  
- About/service queries → `advice` ✅
- Free course queries → `advice` ✅
- Technical queries → `advice` ✅

### **Content Routing Accuracy: 37.5% ❌**
Only 3 out of 8 queries returned the expected content type:

| Query Type | Expected Kind | Actual Kind | Match | Issue |
|------------|---------------|-------------|-------|-------|
| Equipment Advice | `article` | `event` | ❌ | **CRITICAL**: Equipment questions returning events |
| Equipment Advice | `article` | `event` | ❌ | **CRITICAL**: Equipment questions returning events |
| Workshop Events | `event` | `event` | ✅ | Working correctly |
| Workshop Events | `event` | `event` | ✅ | Working correctly |
| About/Service | `landing` | `article` | ❌ | "Who is Alan Ranger" should go to about page |
| About/Service | `service` | `article` | ❌ | Service queries returning articles |
| Free Course | `landing` | `article` | ❌ | Free course queries returning articles |
| Technical | `article` | `article` | ✅ | Working correctly |

## **Critical Issues Identified**

### **1. Equipment Advice Routing Failure**
- **Problem**: Equipment questions are being routed to events instead of articles
- **Impact**: Users asking "What tripod do you recommend?" get event information instead of equipment guides
- **Root Cause**: The cross-entity search logic is prioritizing events over articles for advice queries

### **2. About/Service Page Routing Failure**  
- **Problem**: "Who is Alan Ranger?" and service queries return random articles instead of landing pages
- **Impact**: Users can't find basic information about Alan or his services
- **Root Cause**: Landing pages and services are not being prioritized in search results

### **3. Free Course Routing Failure**
- **Problem**: Free course queries return articles instead of the actual free course landing page
- **Impact**: Users can't find the free course they're looking for
- **Root Cause**: The free course landing page is not being returned in search results

## **Detailed Analysis by Query Type**

### **Equipment Advice Queries**
```
Query: "What tripod do you recommend for landscape photography?"
Expected: article (equipment guide)
Actual: event (RPS mentoring course)
URL: https://www.alanranger.com/beginners-photography-lessons/rps-courses-rps-distinctions-mentoring-2
Confidence: 0.9 (incorrectly high)
```

**Analysis**: The system is finding events with high confidence (0.9) but completely missing the relevant equipment articles. This suggests the search logic is broken for equipment queries.

### **About/Service Queries**
```
Query: "Who is Alan Ranger?"
Expected: landing (about page)
Actual: article (white balance guide)
URL: https://www.alanranger.com/blog-on-photography/what-is-white-balance-in-photography
Confidence: 0.9 (incorrectly high)
```

**Analysis**: The system should be returning the about page or landing pages, but it's returning random articles with high confidence.

### **Free Course Queries**
```
Query: "Is the online photography course really free?"
Expected: landing (free course page)
Actual: article (online photography classes)
URL: https://www.alanranger.com/blog-on-photography/learn-photography-online-photography-classes
Confidence: 0.9 (incorrectly high)
```

**Analysis**: The system is not finding the actual free course landing page, despite it being in the database.

## **Root Cause Analysis**

### **1. Search Function Priority Issues**
The cross-entity search logic appears to be:
- Prioritizing events over articles for advice queries
- Not properly searching landing pages and services
- Returning high confidence scores for mismatched content

### **2. Content Type Classification Issues**
- Equipment queries should prioritize articles with equipment-related content
- About queries should prioritize landing pages
- Service queries should prioritize service pages
- Free course queries should prioritize the specific free course landing page

### **3. Confidence Scoring Issues**
- High confidence (0.9) for completely wrong content types
- No penalty for content type mismatches
- Confidence scoring doesn't reflect actual relevance

## **Next Steps for Fixes**

### **Phase 1: Fix Equipment Advice Routing**
1. Modify search logic to prioritize articles for equipment queries
2. Add equipment-specific keywords to article search
3. Implement content type penalties in confidence scoring

### **Phase 2: Fix About/Service Routing**
1. Ensure landing pages are properly searched and returned
2. Add about-specific routing logic
3. Prioritize service pages for service queries

### **Phase 3: Fix Free Course Routing**
1. Implement direct URL search for free course queries
2. Ensure free course landing page is properly indexed
3. Add free course specific routing logic

### **Phase 4: Improve Confidence Scoring**
1. Add content type mismatch penalties
2. Implement relevance-based scoring
3. Add quality checks for returned content

## **Test Data for Validation**

The following queries should be used to validate fixes:

1. **Equipment**: "What tripod do you recommend?" → Should return tripod article
2. **About**: "Who is Alan Ranger?" → Should return about page
3. **Service**: "What photography services do you offer?" → Should return services page
4. **Free Course**: "Is the online photography course really free?" → Should return free course page
5. **Technical**: "What is ISO in photography?" → Should return ISO article (already working)

## **Success Criteria**

- **Intent Detection**: Maintain 100% accuracy ✅
- **Content Routing**: Achieve 80%+ accuracy (currently 37.5%)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Reflect actual relevance, not just keyword matches
- **Content Quality**: Return appropriate content types for each query
