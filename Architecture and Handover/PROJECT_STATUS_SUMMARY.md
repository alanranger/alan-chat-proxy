## Current Risks

- **Ingestion reliability** ‚Äî current extraction approach is failing on content; JSON-LD extraction patterns (regex) are brittle and miss cases.
- **Data gaps** ‚Äî `workshop_events` and `course_events` are empty; risk of stale/incorrect event responses.
- **Architecture complexity** ‚Äî RAG pipeline and clarification branching are too complex; creates loops and self-corrections.
- **Performance & scale** ‚Äî fixes have been "band-aids"; risk that system fails under hundreds/thousands of queries.
- **Operational drift** ‚Äî Supabase cron "light refresh" status unknown; admin analytics/QA flows may be out of sync.

## Next Actions (2‚Äì3 day horizon)

1. **Events rendering & content correctness**
   - Render **multi-day residential workshop tiles** correctly in event responses.
   - Ensure **tripod article tiles** render with solid title/URL fallbacks.
   - Source **clarification options only from evidence buckets**; suppress generic fallbacks.

2. **Testing & validation**
   - Run **10-key-query live verification** and capture outputs.
   - Validate `v_events_for_chat` / `v_events_real_data` are populated; remove empty tables.
   - Add **regression tests** for tripod + residential pricing/B&B flows.

3. **Data & ingestion**
   - Fix **JSON-LD extraction** (review selectors/regex; validate with `npm run validate:all` on generated payloads).
   - Investigate/resolve **empty `workshop_events` and `course_events`**; prefer **`page_entities`/views** if that's the new contract.
   - Remove the empty legacy tables once views are confirmed as source of truth.

4. **System architecture & reliability**
   - Simplify the **clarification logic** to be more deterministic; add **content-based confidence scoring**.
   - Convert prior "band-aid" fixes into **principled changes** documented in Architecture.

5. **Ops & dashboards**
   - Verify **Supabase light refresh cron** and fix if broken.
   - Revisit **testbench-pro.html**; ensure **admin panel** and **analytics dashboard** reflect current flows.
   - Confirm **cron jobs** run daily at 01:00 and that admin actions (QA Check / Refresh Mappings / Finalize Data) complete end-to-end.
