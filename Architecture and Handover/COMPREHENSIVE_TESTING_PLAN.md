# Comprehensive Testing Plan - All Query Types

## Overview

This document outlines the systematic testing approach for all query types in the chatbot system. We have successfully implemented and validated the **workshop clarification system** as a model implementation. Now we need to test and validate all other query types to ensure they work as well.

## üéØ Testing Strategy

### **Phase 1: Systematic Query Type Testing**
Test each query type systematically to identify gaps and issues.

### **Phase 2: Clarification System Validation**
Ensure evidence-based clarification works for all query types.

### **Phase 3: Gap Analysis & Fixes**
Fix any issues found during testing.

## üîç Testing Methodology

### **Step 1: Live API Testing**
For each test case:
1. Send query to live API: `https://alan-chat-proxy.vercel.app/api/chat`
2. Record response type (clarification vs direct answer)
3. Record confidence level
4. Record clarification options (if applicable)
5. Test follow-up queries

### **Step 2: Response Validation**
For each response:
1. **Clarification Responses**:
   - [ ] Confidence level is appropriate (20% for initial, 50%+ for follow-up)
   - [ ] Options are evidence-based (not generic)
   - [ ] Options are relevant to the query
   - [ ] Options lead to meaningful follow-up queries

2. **Direct Answers**:
   - [ ] Confidence level is high (80%+)
   - [ ] Content is relevant and accurate
   - [ ] Response is well-formatted
   - [ ] No generic fallback responses

### **Step 3: Follow-up Testing**
For each clarification option:
1. Send follow-up query
2. Verify confidence progression
3. Verify content relevance
4. Test final answer quality

## üìä Expected Results Matrix

| Query Type | Initial Confidence | Follow-up Confidence | Final Confidence | Status |
|------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|---------|
| Workshops | 20% | 50% | 95% | ‚úÖ WORKING |
| Courses | 20% | 50% | 80%+ | ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS TESTING |
| Articles | 20% | 50% | 80%+ | ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS TESTING |
| Services | 20% | 50% | 80%+ | ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS TESTING |
| General | 20% | 50% | 80%+ | ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS TESTING |
