- **Response:** Specific to bluebell workshops with multiple date options

#### **Current System (Expected):**
- **Issues:**
  - ‚ùå No specificity for "bluebells ones" follow-up
  - ‚ùå Generic workshop listing instead of bluebell-specific events
  - ‚ùå Missing the specific bluebell workshop URLs
  - ‚ùå No topic-specific filtering

### **Question 5: About Query**
**User:** "who is Alan Ranger?"  
**Follow-up:** "how long has he been teaching and where is he based?"

#### **Business Owner Specification:**
- **Intent:** advice
- **Kind:** landing
- **URLs:** 1 specific about page URL

- **Issues:**
  - ‚ùå Routes to random articles instead of about page
  - ‚ùå No direct answer about experience and location
  - ‚ùå Missing the specific about page URL
  - ‚ùå Known systematic failure from previous analysis

### **Question 6: Service Query**
**User:** "what photography services do you offer?"  
**Follow-up:** "i am interested in private lessons as my work rota and shifts mean i cant do regular evening classes"

#### **Business Owner Specification:**
- **Intent:** advice
- **Kind:** service
- **URLs:** 2 specific private lesson URLs (face-to-face + online)
- **Response:** Addresses work schedule constraint, provides flexible options

#### **Current System (Expected):**
- **Issues:**
  - ‚ùå No context awareness of work schedule constraints
  - ‚ùå Routes to articles instead of service pages
  - ‚ùå Missing the specific private lesson URLs
  - ‚ùå No mention of flexibility for work schedules
  - ‚ùå Known systematic failure from previous analysis
