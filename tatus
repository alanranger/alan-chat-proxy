    Working baseline: Analytics filtering, database health fixes, and regression test improvements
    
    - Fixed analytics questions endpoint to calculate frequency on-demand (chat_question_frequency table was dropped)
    - Added filtering to exclude regression test questions (test- and analytics-test- sessions)
    - Fixed database health risk calculation to use 0 as baseline for perfect health
    - Fixed db_health_extended to only consider tables >= 10MB for bloat risk
    - Fixed Job 39 health status logic (based on job performance, not database health risk)
    - Fixed database health refresh to clear cache and force fresh data
    - All regression test questions now properly excluded from analytics
    - Database health shows 0 risk when everything is healthy
    - VACUUM FULL completed on regression_test_results, job_progress, and cron.job tables
    
    This is a stable working baseline for chat analytics and database health monitoring.
