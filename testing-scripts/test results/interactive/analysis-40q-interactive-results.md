## Critical Issues by Priority

### ðŸ”´ P1: Routing Failures (Wrong Intent/Type)

**Questions Affected:**
- Q9: "What gear or equipment do I need to bring to a workshop?" â†’ Should find from workshop pages/chunks
- Q10: "What is the difference between prime and zoom lenses?" â†’ Didn't answer question
- Q11: "What memory card should I buy?" â†’ Totally irrelevant answer
- Q14: "Is the online photography course really free?" â†’ Wrong course referenced
- Q17: "How do I get personalised feedback on my images" â†’ Should show 1-2-1 service tile
- Q22: "What is long exposure..." â†’ Wrong routing (should find article tiles)
- Q25: "What is white balance..." â†’ Should answer but didn't
- Q26: "What is HDR photography?" â†’ Incorrect initial response
- Q27: "Who is Alan Ranger..." â†’ Good answer but wrong related content
- Q28: "Where is Alan Ranger based?" â†’ Irrelevant answer
- Q31: "Can I hire you as a professional photographer..." â†’ Should answer directly
- Q35: "How do I improve my composition..." â†’ Wrong routing
- Q36: "How do I use flash photography?" â†’ Should say "I don't have an answer"

**Root Causes:**
- Classification routing incorrect
- Content not being retrieved from correct sources
- Hardcoded routes missing these patterns

### ðŸ”´ P1: Missing or Empty Initial Responses

**Questions Affected:**
- Q23: "What is the exposure triangle..." â†’ **No bot initial response**
- Q38: "How do I subscribe to the free online photography course?" â†’ Empty

**Root Causes:**
- Answer generation failing for technical concepts
- Edge case not handled

### ðŸŸ¡ P2: Article Selection & Capping Issues

**Questions Affected:**
- Q5: "My pictures never seem sharp..." â†’ Previously showed more articles (focus, sharp, blurry tags)
- Q7: "What tripod do you recommend" â†’ **Should show ALL related articles with no cap**
- Q10: "What is the difference between prime and zoom lenses?" â†’ Some relevant, some not
- Q24: "What is depth of field..." â†’ Wrong article links, better articles exist
- Q25: "What is white balance..." â†’ No related articles but articles exist in DB
- Q26: "What is HDR photography?" â†’ Articles available that weren't picked (e.g., "what is bracketing")

**Root Causes:**
- Articles hardcapped at 6 (`pickArticles()` returns `result.slice(0,6)`)
- Scoring/relevance algorithm not matching best articles
- Need to remove cap for equipment/technical questions

### ðŸŸ¡ P2: Service/Landing Page Tiles Not Showing

**Questions Affected:**
- Q6: "What types of photography services do you offer?" â†’ Note says "no service tiles showing" but marked Pass
- Q17: "How do I get personalised feedback..." â†’ Should show 1-2-1 private lesson service tile
- Q19: "Do you offer gift vouchers?" â†’ Should show gift voucher service tile
- Q20: "What is your cancellation policy..." â†’ Should show landing page tile
- Q21: "Where is your gallery..." â†’ Should show landing and service pages
- Q27: "Who is Alan Ranger..." â†’ Should use landing pages (about-alan, ethics, testimonials)
- Q28: "Where is Alan Ranger based?" â†’ Should use landing page data
- Q34: "who is alan ranger" â†’ Should show orange pill linked to about-alan page (not articles)

**Root Causes:**
- Services not being retrieved/returned in structured data
- Landing pages not being used for person queries
- Service filtering not working correctly

### ðŸŸ¡ P2: Course vs Workshop Confusion

**Questions Affected:**
- Q15: "What courses do you offer for complete beginners?" â†’ Talks about workshops, not courses
- Q16: "How many weeks is the beginners' photography course?" â†’ Should detect 3 weeks from data

**Root Causes:**
- Classification not distinguishing courses from workshops
- Course data not being retrieved separately

### ðŸŸ¡ P2: Content Type Preference Issues

**Questions Affected:**
- Q27, Q34: Person queries should show landing pages, not articles
- Q31: Professional hire query should filter services to professional services only
- Multiple questions: Should prefer landing pages over articles for certain query types

**Root Causes:**
- No logic to prioritize landing pages for person/business info queries
- Service filtering too broad

### ðŸŸ¡ P2: URLs in Responses (Presentation)

**Questions Affected:**
- Q19: "Do you offer gift vouchers?" â†’ Shouldn't show URL in response
- Q27: "Who is Alan Ranger..." â†’ Shouldn't show URL link in response
- Q34: "who is alan ranger" â†’ Shouldn't need URL in response

**Root Causes:**
- Hardcoded answers including URLs
- Should present cleaner responses

### ðŸŸ¢ P3: Edge Cases Needing Special Handling

**Questions Affected:**
- Q12: "Do you I get a certificate with the photography course" â†’ Should show free online photography course tile
- Q14: "Is the online photography course really free" â†’ Edge case
- Q36: "How do I subscribe to the free online photography course?" â†’ Edge case again
- Q18: "How long are your workshops?" â†’ Picked 3 events but unclear why those 3
- Q4: "when are your next Autumn workshops..." â†’ Missing some 2026 workshops at Batsford

**Root Causes:**
- "Free online photography course" needs special routing/display logic
- Event selection criteria unclear
- Date filtering may be too restrictive

### ðŸŸ¢ P3: Answer Quality Issues

**Questions Affected:**
- Q7: "What tripod do you recommend" â†’ Previously gave conversational response, now only 10% score
- Q13: "Do I need a laptop for the lightroom course" â†’ Should answer in initial response (50% score)
- Q25: "What is white balance..." â†’ Should answer with brief summary conversation style
- Q26: "What is HDR photography?" â†’ Should answer conversationally from article data
- Q33: "peter orton" â†’ Should be more natural conversational answer, not just meta description
- Q35: "How do I improve my composition..." â†’ Should respond conversationally from data
- Q40: "How do I improve my photography skills?" â†’ Should respond conversationally from data

**Root Causes:**
- Answer generation not extracting/summarizing from retrieved content
- Relying too heavily on structured data instead of generating conversational answers
