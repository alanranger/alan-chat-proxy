## ‚ùå ROUTING ISSUES (Need Fix)

### Q17 - Wrong Routing ‚ùå
**Question**: "Do I need a laptop for the lightroom course"
- **Expected**: Route to events (baseline had 6 events)
- **Current**: Route to services (0 events)
- **Issue**: Has "lightroom course" which should trigger courseLogistics, but early exit in handleServiceQueries requires `isWhenQuery` (when/where/next) OR `eventCues` (workshop/event). This query has neither.
- **Root Cause**: Early exit logic too restrictive - course logistics queries without "when/where" or "workshop" keywords are not being caught.

### Q18 - Routing Changed (Content Correct) ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Question**: "Is the online photography course really free"
- **Expected**: Route to events (baseline had 2 events)
- **Current**: Route to advice (0 events)
- **Answer Content**: ‚úÖ Correct! "**Is the Online Photography Course Really Free?** Yes, the full course is completely free..."
- **Issue**: This is actually CORRECT routing - it's a question about the free course service, not an event. The answer content is accurate.
- **Analysis**: This may be a false positive - the answer is better than baseline.

### Q20 - Wrong Routing ‚ùå
**Question**: "How many weeks is the beginners' photography course?"
- **Expected**: Route to events (baseline had 18 events)
- **Current**: Route to services (0 events)
- **Issue**: Has "beginners' photography course" and "weeks" (courseLogistics=true), but no "when/where" (isWhenQuery=false) and no "workshop/event" (eventCues=false).
- **Root Cause**: Same as Q17 - early exit logic too restrictive.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è GENERIC FALLBACKS (Expected Behavior)

These queries correctly return generic fallback because they require specific information not in the knowledge base:

- **Q7**: "Do you do astrophotography workshops" - Generic fallback ‚úÖ
- **Q8**: "Can my 14yr old attend your workshop" - Generic fallback ‚úÖ
- **Q13**: "What gear or equipment do I need to bring to a workshop?" - Generic fallback ‚úÖ
- **Q16**: "Do you I get a certificate with the photography course" - Generic fallback ‚úÖ
- **Q24**: "What is your cancellation or refund policy for courses/workshops?" - Generic fallback ‚úÖ

**Q33**: "Can I hire you as a professional photographer in Coventry?"
- **Note**: Marked as generic fallback in analysis, but CSV shows proper answer:
  - Answer: "**Hiring a Professional Photographer in Coventry**: Alan Ranger offers professional photography services..."
  - This is NOT a generic fallback - analysis may be incorrect.

## üìä DETAILED ROUTING ANALYSIS

### Event Routing Logic Issue
The problem is in `handleServiceQueries()` early exit logic:

```javascript
// Current logic (too restrictive):
if (businessCategory === 'Event Queries' || 
    (courseLogistics && isWhenQuery) || 
    eventCues || 
    isWhenQuery) {
  return null; // Exit to event routing
}
```

**Issue**: Queries like "Do I need a laptop for the lightroom course" have:
- `courseLogistics = true` (has "course")
- `isWhenQuery = false` (no "when/where/next")
- `eventCues = false` (no "workshop/event")

These should still route to events because they're asking about course logistics, but the logic requires `isWhenQuery` to be true.

**Solution Needed**: Course logistics queries should route to events even without "when/where" keywords if they're asking about course requirements/features.

## üéØ SUMMARY

### Fixed Issues ‚úÖ
- Q36 (subscribe to free course) - FIXED
- Q27 (exposure triangle) - FIXED
- Q10, Q19 - Now have answers
- Q18 - Better answer (though routing changed)

### Remaining Issues ‚ùå
- Q17 - Needs to route to events (laptop for lightroom course)
- Q20 - Needs to route to events (how many weeks)
- Early exit logic in handleServiceQueries needs adjustment for course logistics queries

### False Positives ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Q18 routing change may be acceptable (answer is better)
- Q33 is NOT a generic fallback (has proper answer)

---

## üîß RECOMMENDED FIXES

1. **Adjust Early Exit Logic in handleServiceQueries**:
   - Course logistics queries (containing "course" + "lightroom"/"beginners"/"weeks") should route to events even without "when/where" keywords
   - Consider adding: `courseLogistics && /\b(laptop|weeks|need|required|equipment)\b/i.test(query)`

2. **Verify Q33 Analysis**:
   - Check why analysis marked it as generic fallback when it has a proper answer

3. **Consider Q18**:
   - May be acceptable as-is (answer quality is better than baseline)
   - If baseline routing must be preserved, adjust isFreeCourseQuery detection
