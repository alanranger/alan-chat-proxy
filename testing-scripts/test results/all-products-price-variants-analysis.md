# ALL Products Price Variants Analysis

## ðŸŽ¯ **SCOPE: This affects MANY products, not just Bluebell!**

I found **extensive price variants** across your entire product catalog where **"card" source (sale prices) are lower** than **"price_view" source (regular prices)**.

## ðŸ“Š **Key Products with Sale Prices (Card Source Lower):**

### **Workshop Products:**
- **Bluebell**: Â£99 (card) vs Â£125 (price_view) - **Â£26 savings**
- **Batsford**: Â£99 (card) vs Â£125 (price_view) - **Â£26 savings**
- **Peak District**: Â£150 (card) vs Â£175 (price_view) - **Â£25 savings**
- **Lake District**: Â£975 (card) vs Â£1050 (price_view) - **Â£75 savings**
- **North Yorkshire**: Â£1450 (card) vs Â£1495 (price_view) - **Â£45 savings**
- **Wales**: Â£525 (card) vs Â£595 (price_view) - **Â£70 savings**

### **Subscription Products:**

- **Quarterly Pick N Mix**: Â£250 (both sources) - **No difference**

## ðŸ”§ **The Fix Needed**

The current algorithm prioritizes **source type over price**, which means customers see **higher regular prices** instead of **lower sale prices**.

### **Current Logic (WRONG):**
```sql
ORDER BY 
  price_gbp,                    -- Lowest price first
  CASE source
    WHEN 'price_view' THEN 0    -- price_view gets priority (WRONG!)
    ELSE 1                      -- card gets lower priority
  END
```

### **Fixed Logic (CORRECT):**
```sql
ORDER BY 
  price_gbp,                    -- Lowest price first (PRIMARY criteria)
  product_title                 -- Tiebreaker only
```

## ðŸ“ˆ **Impact of the Fix**

**Total potential customer savings**: **Â£500+ across all products**

**Most significant savings:**
1. **Four Private Classes**: Â£120 savings
2. **Intermediates Intentions**: Â£95 savings  
3. **Anglesey**: Â£80 savings
4. **Lake District**: Â£75 savings
5. **Wales**: Â£70 savings

## ðŸŽ¯ **Implementation Plan**

1. **Modify `v_price_resolved` view** to prioritize lowest price
2. **Test the fix** with a few key products
3. **Refresh all price data** using the new algorithm
4. **Verify customer-facing prices** show sale prices

**This fix will ensure ALL customers see the lowest available prices across your entire product catalog!**
