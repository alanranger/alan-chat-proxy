At 240ft (73m) high, Britain's tallest single-drop waterfall (with a drop 20m higher than Niagara Falls) captivates all who visit herâ€”known as one of the seven wonders of Wales with its three stages of drops. Generation after generation take in the spirit and presence of this remarkable place. Surrounding the falls is a viewing platform, bridge, and woodland alongside the Afon Rhaeadr.\nPistyll Rhaeadr offers an excellent opportunity to practice long exposure photography of moving water with many viewpoints of the falls and also down at water level with its laminated slate beds and plenty of mini falls and closer-up compositions to make.\nLake Vyrnwy is a reservoir in Powys, Wales, built in the 1880s for Liverpool Corporation Waterworks to supply Liverpool with fresh water. It flooded the head of the Vyrnwy valley and submerged the village of Llanwddyn. These two locations to give you a real taste of Wales photography",

At 240ft (73m) high, Britain's tallest single-drop waterfall (with a drop 20m higher than Niagara Falls) captivates all who visit herâ€”known as one of the seven wonders of Wales with its three stages of drops. Generation after generation take in the spirit and presence of this remarkable place. Surrounding the falls is a viewing platform, bridge, and woodland alongside the Afon Rhaeadr.\nPistyll Rhaeadr offers an excellent opportunity to practice long exposure photography of moving water with many viewpoints of the falls and also down at water level with its laminated slate beds and plenty of mini falls and closer-up compositions to make.\nLake Vyrnwy is a reservoir in Powys, Wales, built in the 1880s for Liverpool Corporation Waterworks to supply Liverpool with fresh water. It flooded the head of the Vyrnwy valley and submerged the village of Llanwddyn. These two locations to give you a real taste of Wales photography",
