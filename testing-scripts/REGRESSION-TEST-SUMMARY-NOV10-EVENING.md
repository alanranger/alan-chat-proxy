## 🎯 Assessment

### Overall Status: ✅ STABLE WITH IMPROVEMENTS

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ No functional regressions - all questions still answer correctly
- ✅ Routing improvements - better classification (services → events)
- ✅ Confidence improved - +1.2% average
- ✅ Structured data significantly improved - +135% more items
- ⚠️ Minor answer length variations - likely due to more concise formatting or different content retrieval

**Conclusion:** System is stable. The "regressions" are minor answer length reductions, not failures. The improvements (better routing, higher confidence, significantly more structured data) far outweigh the minor length reductions.
