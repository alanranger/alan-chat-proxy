for the 28 questions where i scored the initial response low or high?","commandType":4},{"text":"you know the 28 queries because its the 28 questions we have been using for all
the testing and analysing the dresults in interactive-testing.html.... i cant believe you just asked me for the 28 queries.  deeply worrying that you
asked","commandType":4},{"text":" dont want you to chane anything yet and you mustnt untill i approve it and give you permission to make changes to existing logic.  you have a
track record of making changes based on assumptions and causing major issues and losing days of work so NO, do not make changes, you are supposed to be analysing he code to
establish where there are different paths beinbg uses, which ones are hard coded, using chunks/rag, question by question and then showing the score i gave each question initial
response and put all this in a table format so we can easily identify if your theory is correct or shows something esle..  Understood?","commandType":4},{"text":"good table but
you need to do your analysis to establish all the unknowwns by reviewing the code chat.js and chat.html","commandType":4},{"text":"sorry can you explain that simply and also show
me the table again","commandType":4},{"text":"export csv","commandType":4},{"text":"that aall quite confusing to me.\n\nthere is no correlation between questions that are scoring
below 55 in this response being hardcoded, chunks, events or clarification and whether the response is converstional, generic etc\n\nso this doest really suggest as you did that
we need to completely change the architecure as there is not an obvious connection to one type of question category over another method","commandType":4},{"text":"ok this sounds
like a good plan.\n\nIn addition you need reduce the complexity showing in chat.js sonarqube for the 3 high severity warnings shown in the screenshot,  you were instructed
not to bloat the code complexity above the recommnded allowed of 15 after we spent nearly 5 days solid refactoring this file two weeks ago and its already creeping back up again

hard","commandType":4},{"text":"did it complete?","commandType":4},{"text":"ffs, i am fed up of this.  why are you not using an existing test script that you have used
consistently umpteen times before to assess whether your refactore has broken and logic or changed the score and quality of previous responses for the same questions.\n\n\nWhat
test did you run before refactoring the 3 issues today?\n","commandType":4},{"text":"cant believe you didnt run a test to capture a baseline before making changes. i explicity
asked you to do this.\n\nok.  run it now and compare against last saved baseline but tell me the date of that baseline so we know how out of date it

this:\n\nthe repo is clearly cluttered now because you create files all over the place\n\nMove all the testing js and cjs files into a folder called Testing Scripts\nmove all the
