# Service Links & Complexity Refactoring - Nov 2, 2025

**Date**: 2 Nov 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Deployed to Production  
**Commits**: `7dd26aa`, `0b8951f`

## 🎯 Changes Implemented

### 1. Service Links for Personalised Feedback Queries
**Problem**: When users asked "How do I get personalised feedback on my images", the response was excellent but didn't show service page links to online Zoom 1-2-1 and face-to-face private lessons.

**Solution**: Enhanced `handleServicePatternResponse()` function to detect personalised feedback queries and automatically fetch relevant services:
- **Online/Zoom services**: Services containing "online", "zoom", or "1-2-1" in title/URL
- **Face-to-face services**: Services containing "face-to-face" or "private" but NOT "online" or "zoom"
- Services are filtered, deduplicated, and added to structured response (up to 6 services)

**Code Changes**:
- Added `isPersonalisedFeedbackQuery` detection in `handleServicePatternResponse()`
- Implemented service filtering logic to separate online vs face-to-face services
- Added deduplication by URL to prevent duplicate service tiles

**Impact**: Users asking about personalised feedback now see clickable service tiles for both online and face-to-face options, improving UX and conversion potential.

### 2. Complexity Refactoring: enrichAdviceWithRelatedInfo
**Problem**: `enrichAdviceWithRelatedInfo()` function had cognitive complexity of 21, exceeding the allowed limit of 15.

**Solution**: Extracted 3 helper functions to reduce complexity:
1. **`hasAnyRelatedInfo(enriched)`**: Checks if structured object has any related info (articles, services, events, products)
2. **`addFallbackArticles(client, keywords, enriched)`**: Handles fallback article search logic when no related info is found
3. **`addMissingEnrichmentItems(client, keywords, enriched, businessCategory, query)`**: Adds missing services, events, and products based on query

**Complexity Reduction**: 
- **Before**: 21 (exceeds limit)
- **After**: ≤15 (within limit)
- **Method**: Extracted nested conditionals and async operations into separate helper functions

**Impact**: Code is more maintainable, easier to test, and meets complexity standards. Functionality preserved 100%.

## 📊 Test Results

### Service Links Test
- ✅ **Query**: "How do I get personalised feedback on my images"
- ✅ **Result**: Response includes service tiles for:
  - Online Zoom 1-2-1 private lessons
  - Face-to-face private lessons
- ✅ **Status**: Verified in production

### Complexity Verification
- ✅ **Function**: `enrichAdviceWithRelatedInfo()` at line 10171
- ✅ **Complexity**: ≤15 (verified with ESLint)
- ✅ **Helper Functions**: All 3 helpers maintain ≤15 complexity
- ✅ **Functionality**: Preserved - no regressions
