## Latest Snapshot
- **15 Nov 2025** — CSV Import Complete Fix: Fixed all non-event CSV import failures (Files 01, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08). Three-part fix: (1) Manual upsert for non-event types since PostgREST doesn't support partial unique indexes in onConflict, (2) Batch delete operations for large URL lists (PostgREST .in() clause limit ~100 items), (3) Foreign key constraint handling - nullify page_entities and page_chunks references before deletion. All 8 CSV files now import successfully. Verified: No duplicates in database after ingestion. Commits: `ec361d9` (onConflict fix), `7f61645` (manual upsert), `0fbd0f7` (batch delete), `065ae62` (foreign key handling)
- **15 Nov 2025** — Equipment Filtering Fix & 40Q Regression Test: Implemented hard filter for equipment queries to remove irrelevant landscape articles. Equipment queries (tripod, camera, memory card, lenses) now only show articles that match equipment keywords in title/URL. Verified with 40Q regression test: 100% success rate (40/40), 82.8% confidence (unchanged), equipment queries showing relevant articles, landscape queries unaffected. Regression test script documented: `test-40q-deployed.cjs` (primary regression test), comparison script: `compare-40q-baseline-vs-current.cjs`. Baseline: `deployed-analytics-test-2025-11-10T22-57-04-965Z.json`
- **14 Nov 2025** — Light-Refresh Edge Function Fix: Fixed critical issue where light-refresh Edge Function was only checking event URLs from `v_events_for_chat` instead of all URLs. Updated Edge Function to query `csv_metadata` table for ALL unique URLs (blog articles, products, events, etc.). System now checks all content types for changes via cron job, not just events. Deployed as Edge Function version 8
- **14 Nov 2025** — Article Search Keyword Filtering Fix: Fixed issue where photography genre keywords (landscape, portrait, travel, studio, macro, wildlife, street) were being filtered out of article searches. Added these keywords to `filterArticleKeywords()` allow list in `api/chat.js`. Articles with genre-specific queries now properly appear in search results
- **14 Nov 2025** — Article Ingestion Root Cause Fix: Identified and fixed root cause where new blog articles were not appearing in search results because they were missing from the source CSV file. Article was in database but not in CSV, so ingestion never processed it. Added article to CSV, re-imported metadata, re-ingested content. Article now appears correctly in search results with fresh timestamps
- **13 Nov 2025** — CSV Import Event Date Cleanup Fix: Fixed critical issue where CSV import was not removing old event dates when re-importing CSVs with rescheduled dates. Added deletion logic in `importCourseEventMetadata()` and `importWorkshopEventMetadata()` to remove old csv_metadata entries for URLs before inserting new ones. Fixed foreign key constraint issue by nullifying `page_entities.csv_metadata_id` references before deletion. System now properly cleans up old dates from both csv_metadata and page_entities when CSVs are re-imported. Verified: old dates (2025-11-29) successfully removed, new dates (2026-05-30) correctly stored. Chat bot now displays correct rescheduled dates automatically
- **11 Nov 2025** — Event Date Cleanup Fix: Fixed issue where rescheduled events created duplicate entries - old dates were not removed when events were rescheduled. Added automatic cleanup logic to delete old event dates that are no longer in source data before ingesting new dates. System now automatically removes outdated dates when events are rescheduled, ensuring only current dates remain in database. Test script created to verify cleanup behavior
- **11 Nov 2025** — Article Deduplication Fix: Fixed duplicate articles appearing in response - articles were appearing 12x (same article repeated) and 2x (each unique article duplicated). Added deduplication in `processAndSortResults()` and `addArticlesForEnrichment()` to ensure unique articles by page_url/id. Fixes regression caused by JSON-LD ingestion making search more effective
- **10 Nov 2025** — Service Reconciliation Fix: Fixed deduplication bug in service reconciliation - now processes 24 unique URLs instead of 552 duplicate rows. All 24 missing services successfully ingested (100% success rate). Reconciliation endpoint deduplicates URLs before processing
- **10 Nov 2025** — 40Q Regression Test & Structured Data Analysis: Ran comprehensive regression test showing 100% success rate, +1.2% confidence improvement (81.6% → 82.8%), 6 improvements, 7 minor regressions (answer length only). Structured data comparison shows +412 items (+135% improvement), 32 improvements, 2 minor regressions. Created comparison scripts for structured data validation
- **10 Nov 2025** — JSON-LD Product Entity Creation: Modified ingest code to create Product entities when Product JSON-LD is present. Product entities now properly stored with price, availability, currency. Both Event and Product entities coexist. Regression test: 100% success rate, +1.2% confidence improvement, better routing for course queries
- **10 Nov 2025** — ETag-Based Change Detection: Implemented ETag header support in light-refresh Edge Function for change detection when last-modified headers unavailable. All URLs now have change detection capability
- **10 Nov 2025** — Event-Product Mapping Export Fix: Fixed bug where dates were incorrectly overwritten for multi-date events. All dates now correct in mappings CSV
- **10 Nov 2025** — View Deduplication: Added DISTINCT ON clauses to prevent duplicate rows in v_events_for_chat and v_products_unified_open views
- **2 Nov 2025** — Analytics dashboard improvements: Added next/previous navigation buttons to question detail modal with position indicator "Question X/Y". Increased questions API limit from 20 to 1000 to show all questions. Verified admin panel needs no updates
