# PROJECT STATUS - October 23, 2025

## üéØ **CURRENT POSITION**

### ‚úÖ **MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS:**
1. **Fixed 5 Business Service Queries** - Successfully improved confidence scoring for:
   - "do you do commercial photography": 10% ‚Üí 51% (+41 points)
   - "do you do portrait photography": 10% ‚Üí 51% (+41 points)  
   - "why are my images always grainy and noisy": 10% ‚Üí 51% (+41 points)
   - "what camera do i need for your courses and workshops": 10% ‚Üí 51% (+41 points)
   - "is your photography academy really free": 10% ‚Üí 51% (+41 points)

2. **Implemented Service Pattern Matching** - Added specific responses for business service queries
3. **Implemented Technical Pattern Matching** - Added specific responses for technical queries
4. **Fixed Query Classification** - Equipment queries now route to RAG instead of events
5. **Enhanced Quality Analysis System** - New confidence scoring based on quality indicators

### ‚ùå **CURRENT PROBLEMS:**
1. **Technical Queries Underperforming** - Confidence scoring too conservative:
   - "what is exposure triangle": 100% ‚Üí 51% (-49 points)
   - "what tripod do you recommend": 95% ‚Üí 51% (-44 points)
   - "who is alan ranger": 75% ‚Üí 51% (-24 points)

2. **Systematic Decline** - Our fixes for business queries caused 9-10 point decline across technical queries
3. **Confidence Scoring Algorithm** - Too broad changes affected entire system, not just target queries

## üìä **CURRENT SCORING COMPARISON:**
- **Alan's Average**: 83.9/100
- **Original Average**: 69.3/100  
- **Current Average**: 56.4/100
- **Current vs Alan**: -27.5 points (system too conservative)
- **Current vs Original**: -12.9 points (decline from baseline)

## üîß **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**
- **Service Patterns**: Added specific responses for business service queries
- **Technical Patterns**: Added specific responses for technical queries  
- **Query Classification**: Fixed equipment queries routing
- **Quality Analysis**: New confidence scoring system with quality indicators
- **Pattern Matching**: Integrated service and technical patterns into RAG system

## üéØ **NEXT STEPS NEEDED:**
1. **Recalibrate Confidence Scoring** - Improve technical queries without breaking business query fixes
2. **Targeted Scoring Fixes** - Implement query-type-specific confidence scoring
3. **Iterative Testing** - Fix ‚Üí test ‚Üí measure ‚Üí repeat until quality targets met
4. **Final Validation** - Both automated tests and Alan's interactive testing

## üìà **SUCCESS METRICS:**
- **Business Service Queries**: ‚úÖ Fixed (5/5 improved significantly)
- **Technical Queries**: ‚ùå Need improvement (declined by 9-10 points)
- **Event Queries**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Mixed results (some improved, some declined)
- **Overall System**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs recalibration to match Alan's quality standards

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUE:**
The confidence scoring algorithm changes were too broad and negatively impacted queries beyond the 5 we targeted. Need more targeted fixes that only affect specific query types without degrading others.
