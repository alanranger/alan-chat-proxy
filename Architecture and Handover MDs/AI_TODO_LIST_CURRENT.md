## 🧩 Overview
This file replaces the old `AI_TODO_LIST_2025-01-23.md` as the **current active scratchpad** for ongoing development.  
It is used for:
- Tracking live development tasks  
- Recording fixes or adjustments made inside Cursor AI  
- Maintaining a lightweight progress record between sessions  

All older references or notes can be found inside `/Archive/AI_TODO_LIST_2025-01-23.md`.

3. Then open **`/testing-scripts/compare-test-results.js`** and **`/debugs/debug-comparison-logic.cjs`**.  
4. Confirm outputs appear in **`/testing-scripts/test results/`**.  
5. Log any inconsistencies here under “Active Tasks”.
