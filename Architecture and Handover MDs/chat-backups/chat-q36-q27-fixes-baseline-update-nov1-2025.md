- Restored clean routing logic for course queries
- Fixed Q36 pattern matching in `SERVICE_PATTERNS`
- Fixed Q27 technical answer generation
- Removed Q36 interception from `checkContactAlanQuery`

### Testing Infrastructure
- Updated `analyze-40q-results.cjs` to use Nov 1, 2025 baseline
- Updated `make-40q-side-by-side-oct28.cjs` to use Nov 1, 2025 baseline
- Generated comprehensive response analysis: `40Q-RESPONSE-ANALYSIS-2025-11-01.md`
- Created latest side-by-side comparison: `side-by-side-40q-oct28-baseline-vs-current-1762003972388.csv`

### Documentation Updates
- `PROJECT_PROGRESS_MASTER.md` - Updated with Nov 1 snapshot
- `AI_TODO_LIST_CURRENT.md` - Added completed tasks and updated active focus
- `HANDOVER_2025-11-01-14-00.md` - Updated system status
- `TESTING_MASTER_PLAN.md` - Added current baseline and testing workflow
- `README_UPDATED.md` - Updated performance metrics and remaining issues

## Test Results Summary

**40Q Test (Nov 1, 2025 13:32)**
- **Success Rate**: 100% (40/40 questions return 200 status)
- **Quality Pass Rate**: 92.5% (3 routing issues, 5 expected generic fallbacks)
- **Average Confidence**: 81.6%
- **Baseline File**: `baseline-40-question-interactive-subset-2025-11-01T13-32-45-780Z.json`

**Fixed Issues** ✅
- Q36: Subscribe to free course - Now returns proper answer (391 chars)
- Q27: Exposure triangle - Now returns proper technical answer

**Remaining Issues** ❌
- Q17: "Do I need a laptop for the lightroom course" - Routing to services instead of events
- Q20: "How many weeks is the beginners' photography course?" - Routing to services instead of events

**Expected Generic Fallbacks** (Information not in knowledge base)
- Q7: Astrophotography workshops
- Q8: Age restrictions for workshops
- Q13: Equipment needed for workshops
- Q16: Certificate with course
- Q24: Cancellation/refund policy

## Key Insights

1. **Q36 Issue Root Cause**: Pattern was being intercepted by `checkContactAlanQuery` before `handleServiceQueries` could process it. Fix: Removed pattern from `checkContactAlanQuery`.

2. **Q17/Q20 Routing Issue**: Course logistics queries without "when/where" keywords are not being caught by early exit logic in `handleServiceQueries`. Early exit requires `isWhenQuery` OR `eventCues`, but these queries have neither.

3. **Debug Code Impact**: Extensive Q36 debug code was added during troubleshooting but needed to be removed for production. All debug code successfully removed while preserving functionality.

4. **Baseline Management**: Established new baseline to track future changes. Previous Oct 28 baseline preserved for historical comparison.
