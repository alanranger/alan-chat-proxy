# Documentation Cleanup â€” Next Steps

1) Move the listed source files into `/archive/` as per **CONSOLIDATION_MAP_2025-10-28.md**.
2) Keep and iterate only the master docs:
   - HANDOVER_2025-10-28_CHAT_RECOVERY.md
   - SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md
   - IMPLEMENTATION_AND_REFACTOR_PLAN.md
   - TESTING_MASTER_PLAN.md
   - DEBUGGING_PROTOCOL.md
   - CODING_STANDARDS.md
   - STANDING_RULES.md
   - PROJECT_PROGRESS_MASTER.md
   - INGESTION_ANALYSIS_AND_FIX_PLAN.md
   - MIGRATION_GUIDE.md
   - HONEST_ASSESSMENT.md
3) Update internal links and README to point at these master docs.
