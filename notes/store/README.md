# Notes Store (Scratchpad)

This folder is a writable scratch area for Cursor/AI:
- Use for TODOs, drafts, working notes, temporary checklists.
- Promote finalized content into the **Architecture and Handover/** docs via reviewed patches.
- Itâ€™s OK to commit these files, or add `notes/store/*` to .gitignore if you prefer not to.

**Conventions**
- One Markdown file per note.
- First line is a `# Title`.
- Append new updates under an `## Updates` section with date/time.
