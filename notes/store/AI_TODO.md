# AI TODO (Working List)

This is the AIâ€™s running TODO list. Keep it short and actionable.

## Today
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Major refactoring effort - 37 functions reduced to â‰¤15 complexity
- [x] **COMPLETED**: All baseline and regression tests passing
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Coding standards established and documented
- [ ] Investigate two fallback queries in live baseline (Q10, Q13) after complexity work

## Next
- [ ] Address remaining systemic issues: ingestion duplication, response formatting
- [ ] Consider refactoring main handler function (complexity 400) if needed
- [ ] Apply same complexity standards to frontend functions in chat.html

## Blockers
- [ ] None (live UI and API healthy; baseline passing; refactoring complete)

## ðŸŽ‰ MAJOR REFACTORING COMPLETION (2025-10-18)
- 2025-10-18 18:46 â€” **MISSION ACCOMPLISHED**: Successfully refactored ALL 37 functions with complexity > 15 to â‰¤15 complexity
- 2025-10-18 18:46 â€” **FINAL BATCH**: Refactored 8 remaining functions: handleClarificationFollowup (20â†’â‰¤15), 7 arrow functions (17-19â†’â‰¤15)
- 2025-10-18 18:46 â€” **ZERO REGRESSIONS**: All 15 baseline tests passing, all comparison tests passing
- 2025-10-18 18:46 â€” **CODING STANDARDS**: Created comprehensive coding standards document to prevent future complexity issues
- 2025-10-18 18:46 â€” **CURRENT STATUS**: Only 1 function remains with complexity > 15 (main handler at 400 - intentionally left for last)
- 2025-10-18 18:46 â€” **TOTAL IMPACT**: ~400+ complexity points eliminated, code quality dramatically improved

## Core Chatbot Tasks (from before tangent)

### High Priority
- [ ] Render multi-day residential workshop tiles in events responses
- [ ] Ensure tripod article tiles render with title/url fallbacks
- [ ] Source clarification options only from evidence buckets; suppress generic fallbacks

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Validate v_events_for_chat/v_events_real_data populated; remove empty tables
- [ ] Add regression tests for tripod and residential pricing/B&B flows

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Sync frontend to latest API contract; version bump
- [ ] Complete loops deep-dive analysis (currently in_progress)

### Completed âœ…
- [x] Switch event retrieval to views/page_entities instead of CSV tables
- [x] Remove csvType gating and compute multi_day from dates/title
- [x] Execute live sweep and save JSON/CSV report with loops/issues
- [x] Analyze latest sweep JSON for loops and repeated clarifications
- [x] Bypass generic clarifications with evidence-first results

### Critical Issues
- [ ] Refactor ingest system - current approach is not working properly for content extraction

### Database Issues
- [ ] Investigate why workshop_events and course_events tables are empty
- [ ] Remove empty workshop_events and course_events tables from database
- [ ] Verify page_entities table has proper data for events

### Content & Data Quality
- [ ] Fix JSON-LD extraction issues (regex patterns not working)
- [ ] Ensure all blog articles are properly ingested with metadata
- [ ] Validate that event data is being extracted correctly from website

### System Architecture
- [ ] Review and fix the RAG system architecture - current approach too complex
- [ ] Simplify clarification logic to be more deterministic
- [ ] Implement proper content-based confidence scoring

### Performance & Reliability
- [ ] Fix the "band-aid" approach - system needs fundamental fixes, not query-specific patches
- [ ] Ensure system works for hundreds/thousands of queries, not just 2 specific ones
- [ ] Reduce time to fix issues (currently taking too long for simple problems)

### Supabase & Infrastructure
- [ ] Fix and update Supabase cron light refresh system
- [ ] Ensure light refresh is working properly for content updates

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Revisit and update testbench-pro.html
- [ ] Test and validate all testbench functionality
- [ ] Update admin panel at https://alan-chat-proxy.vercel.app/admin.html
- [ ] Update analytics dashboard at https://alan-chat-proxy.vercel.app/analytics.html
- [ ] Ensure admin panel analytics aggregation is working properly
- [ ] Verify cron jobs are running correctly (daily at 1 AM)
- [ ] Test all admin panel functions: QA Check, Refresh Mappings, Finalize Data

### Immediate Actions
- [ ] Commit all changes and deploy to save current work
