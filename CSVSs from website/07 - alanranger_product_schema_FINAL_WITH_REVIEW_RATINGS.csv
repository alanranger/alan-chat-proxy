You can opt for close-up sketches of woodland growth, rocks and water or tackle a wider vista showing the river and work on long exposures, water abstracts and much more.\nBolehill Quarry -\nCreated hundreds of millions of years ago by the power of natural forces, the last few centuries have seen the rugged landscape surrounding Padley Gorge sculpted by man who long ago quarried these gritstone Edges for stone and tunnelled deep beneath the moors to drive a railway line through the hills. Now an area of outstanding natural beauty, this walk takes in the breathtaking heights of Millstone Edge and majestic silver birch woodlands.
