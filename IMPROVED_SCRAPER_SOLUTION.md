# Improved Scraper Solution

## ðŸŽ¯ **Root Cause Identified**

The scraper **IS working** and **IS extracting real data** from your website pages, but it's **not parsing it into structured entities**. The data is there in the text chunks, but the JSON-LD extraction is failing because your website doesn't have proper structured data markup.

## âœ… **What the Scraper IS Finding (Real Data):**

From the chunk analysis, I can see the scraper is extracting:
- **Real Times**: "19:00 21:00" (not midnight!)
- **Real Locations**: "45 Hathaway Road Coventry, England, CV4 9HW United Kingdom"
- **Real Online Events**: "Online - Virtual Class - Zoom Meeting"
- **Real Prices**: "Â£150.00"
- **Real Dates**: "Tuesday 13 January 2026"

## ðŸ”§ **The Solution: Enhanced Scraper**

### **Option 1: Improve the Scraper (Recommended)**

We can **enhance the scraper** to extract structured data from HTML content instead of relying on JSON-LD. The scraper already has the real data - we just need to parse it better.

### **Option 2: Use CSV as Fallback**

If the scraper improvement is complex, we can use the CSV files as a fallback for events while keeping the scraper for other content.

## ðŸš€ **Implementation Options:**

### **Option A: Enhanced Scraper Only**
1. **Improve the scraper** to extract structured data from HTML content
2. **Parse event data** from the text chunks that are already being extracted
3. **Create structured entities** from the parsed data
4. **Keep the scraper** for all content (events, articles, services, etc.)

### **Option B: Hybrid Approach**
1. **Keep the scraper** for articles, services, and other content
2. **Use CSV data** as a fallback for events
3. **Combine both sources** in the final views

## ðŸ’¡ **Recommendation:**

**Option A (Enhanced Scraper)** is better because:
- âœ… **Single source of truth** - all data comes from the scraper
- âœ… **Scalable** - new events automatically included
- âœ… **Consistent** - same extraction logic for all content
- âœ… **Real-time** - data stays current with website changes

## ðŸ“‹ **Next Steps:**

1. **Test the enhanced scraper approach** with `ENHANCED_SCRAPER_APPROACH.sql`
2. **Verify it extracts real data** from the existing chunks
3. **Update the chatbot** to use the new views
4. **Remove hardwired logic** once the enhanced scraper is working

This approach gives you **accurate, real data** that matches what users see on your website, while keeping the scraper as the single source of truth for all content.
