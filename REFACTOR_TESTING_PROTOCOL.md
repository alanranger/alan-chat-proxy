# REFACTOR TESTING PROTOCOL

## CRITICAL: Every Refactor Step Must Be Tested

### Before Making ANY Changes:
1. **Run quality benchmark test** to establish current baseline
2. **Document the baseline metrics** (quality score, pass/fail counts)
3. **Save results** with timestamp for comparison

### After Each Refactor Step:
1. **Run quality benchmark test** immediately
2. **Compare to previous baseline** - look for:
   - Overall quality score changes
   - Individual test pass/fail changes
   - Specific question regressions
3. **If regression detected**:
   - **STOP** and revert changes
   - **Analyze** what broke
   - **Fix** the issue before proceeding
4. **Only proceed** if quality is maintained or improved

### Regression Thresholds:
- **Quality Score**: Must stay within Â±5 points of baseline
- **Pass Rate**: Must not decrease by more than 1 test
- **Individual Questions**: Must not drop by more than 10 points

### Documentation Required:
- **Before/After metrics** for each step
- **Specific regressions** identified
- **Root cause analysis** for any failures
- **Fix applied** and verification

## Current Status: MASSIVE REGRESSION DETECTED
- **Baseline**: 69/100, 19/20 passed
- **Current**: 49/100, 3/28 passed
- **Action Required**: IMMEDIATE REVERT AND ANALYSIS
