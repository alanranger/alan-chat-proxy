      "fullResponse": "Hi! I can help with workshops, tuition, technical photography questions, equipment recommendations, and course information. Ask me anything about Alan's services or photography techniques! Exposure in photography refers to the amount of light that reaches your camera's sensor when you take a photo. It's controlled by three main settings: aperture (how wide the lens opening is), shutter speed (how long the sensor is exposed to light), and ISO (the sensor's sensitivity to light). Getting the right exposure means balancing these three settings so your photo isn't too dark (underexposed) or too bright (overexposed). üìö Related Photography Guides\n      \n        \n      \n        \n          \n          \n            01 What is EXPOSURE in photography: A Guide for Beginners\n          \n          \n          What is exposure in photography?

To fix this: use a faster shutter speed (at least 1/focal length), hold your camera steady, use proper focusing techniques, ensure adequate lighting, and consider using a tripod for slower shutter speeds. Practice proper camera holding technique and learn to use your camera's autofocus effectively.",
