    "chatgptContent": "Exposure in photography refers to the amount of light that reaches your camera's sensor when you take a photo. It's controlled by three main settings: aperture (how wide the lens opening is), shutter speed (how long the sensor is exposed to light), and ISO (the sensor's sensitivity to light). Getting the right exposure means balancing these three settings so your photo isn't too dark (underexposed) or too bright (overexposed).",
