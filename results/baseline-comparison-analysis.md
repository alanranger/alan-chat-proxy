### Pill Availability
- **Has Pills**: 28 (8%)
- **No Pills**: 336 (92%)

### Problematic Responses
- **Total Problematic**: 338 (93%)

## Key Findings

### 1. System Status
The current system is **already running the evidence-based direct answer system** (v1.3.19-evidence-based), but the results show the same 93% problematic response rate as the original baseline.

### 2. Response Type Analysis
- **84% Clarification**: Most queries are still going through clarification instead of direct answers
- **15% Advice**: Some direct answers are being provided
- **1% Events**: Very few event-specific responses

### 3. Confidence Issues
- **93% Low Confidence**: The vast majority of responses have very low confidence
- **Only 7% High Confidence**: Very few responses reach the target 80%+ confidence

### 4. Answer Quality
- **84% No Answer**: Most responses don't provide actual answers
- **Only 16% Have Answers**: Very low answer provision rate

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Query Classification Not Working
Despite having `classifyQuery()` function, 84% of queries are still going to clarification instead of direct answers. This suggests:
- The classification patterns may not be matching the actual questions
- The direct answer routing may not be working properly
- The evidence extraction may be failing

### 2. Evidence Extraction Problems
The low confidence and lack of answers suggests:
- `findArticles()`, `findServices()`, `findEvents()` may be returning empty results
- The evidence-based answer generation may not be working
- Database queries may be failing

### 3. Clarification System Overuse
84% clarification rate indicates:
- The system is defaulting to clarification too often
- Direct answer patterns may be too restrictive
- The confidence threshold logic may be flawed

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Debug Query Classification**: Test why 84% of queries aren't being classified as direct answers
2. **Debug Evidence Extraction**: Verify that `findArticles()`, `findServices()`, `findEvents()` are returning data
3. **Debug Direct Answer Routing**: Ensure `handleDirectAnswerQuery()` is being called for appropriate queries
4. **Review Classification Patterns**: The regex patterns in `classifyQuery()` may need expansion

### Testing Strategy
1. Test individual functions in isolation
2. Add debug logging to trace query flow
3. Test with known working queries to verify system components
4. Compare working vs non-working query patterns

## Conclusion

The evidence-based system is deployed but **not functioning as expected**. The 93% problematic response rate indicates fundamental issues with:
- Query classification accuracy
- Evidence extraction from database
- Direct answer generation
- Confidence calculation

**Next Steps**: Debug the core system components to identify why the evidence-based system isn't providing the expected improvements.
