## ⚠️ **REMAINING ISSUE: View Dependencies**

### **Problem:**
The `v_products_unified_open` view is still showing old prices because it depends on a missing `v_products_unified` view.

### **Current Status:**
- ✅ `product_display_price` table has correct prices
- ❌ `v_products_unified_open` view shows old prices
- ❌ `v_event_product_mappings` shows old prices (depends on above view)

### **Root Cause:**
The view dependency chain is broken:
```
v_event_product_mappings 
  → v_event_product_final_enhanced 
    → v_products_unified_open 
      → v_products_unified (MISSING!)
```

## 🔧 **Next Steps Required:**

### **Option 1: Recreate Missing View**
- Create the missing `v_products_unified` view
- Ensure it properly joins with `product_display_price`

### **Option 2: Direct View Update**
- Update `v_products_unified_open` to directly use `product_display_price`
- Bypass the missing intermediate view

### **Option 3: Refresh All Views**
- Drop and recreate all dependent views
- Ensure proper data flow

## 📊 **Impact:**
- **Total Customer Savings**: £500+ across all products
- **Most Significant**: Four Private Classes (£120 savings)
- **Workshop Savings**: £25-£80 per workshop
- **Course Savings**: £95-£120 per course

**The price fix is 90% complete - just need to resolve the view dependency issue to make it fully functional.**
